Code for rendering hershey fonts within node-canvas

This is code for rendering Hershey fonts within a canvas context.

The Hershey fonts were designed by Dr A V Hershey. They have no copyright claim that I know of when not distributed in the original NTIS format, and so are redistributed here, in the form distributed by Debian and [maintained by Kamal Mostafa](http://www.whence.com/hershey-fonts/). They were converted into this format by James Hurt.

I also include Kirk Reinholz's conversion table from the original Hershey identifiers to Unicode points, as found [here](https://github.com/reinholtz/hershey-fonts-with-unicode/blob/master/hersheyunicodemap.csv).

For an example of usage, please see test.ts.
