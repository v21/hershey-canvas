Code for rendering hershey fonts within node-canvas

This is code for rendering Hershey fonts within a canvas context.

The Hershey fonts were designed by Dr A V Hershey. They have no copyright claim that I know of, and so are redistributed here, in the form distributed by Debian and [[maintained by Kamal Mostafa|http://www.whence.com/hershey-fonts/]]. They were converted into this format by James Hurt.

I also include Kirk Reinholz's conversion table from the original Hershey identifiers to Unicode points, as found [[here|https://github.com/reinholtz/hershey-fonts-with-unicode/blob/master/hersheyunicodemap.csv]].
